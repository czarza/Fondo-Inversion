          <b>4.8.</b> Each trade is subject to the cost of spreads and commissions on opening and to
          the swap that is applied every night at a cost of 0.015% and up to 2% on
          cryptocurrency.</p><p>
          <b>Rollover Definition</b><br />
          Rollover is also called Swap. It is the interest paid or for holding a position overnight.
          Each world currency has an interest rate connected to it. Since forex is traded in pairs,
          every trade involves not only two different currencies, but also two different interest
          rates. If the interest rate on the currency you bought is higher than the interest rate of
          the currency you sold, then you will earn rollover (positive roll). If the interest rate on
          the currency you bought is lower than the interest rate on the currency you sold, then
          you will pay rollover (negative roll). Rollover can add a significant extra cost or profit
          to your trade depending.</p><p>
          <b>Rollover Example</b><br />
          When you buy the EUR/USD pair, you are buying the euro, and selling the U.S.
          dollar to pay for it. If the euro interest rate is 1.00%, and the U.S. rate is 0.25%, you
          are buying the currency with the higher interest rate, and you will earn rollover —
          about 0.75% on an annual basis. Conversely, you sell the EUR/USD pair, you are
          selling the currency with the higher interest rate, and you will pay rollover — about
          0.75% on an annual basis, since you are paying the euro interest rate and earning the
          U.S. interest rate.</p><p>
          <b>Rollover Booking Times</b><br />
          The beginning and end of the forex trading day is considered to be 00:00 (GMT) by
          our servers. Any positions that are open at 00:00 (GMT) sharp are considered to be
          held overnight and are subject to rollover. A position opened at 00:01 (GMT) is not
          subject to rollover until the next day, while a position opened at 23:59 (GMT) is
          subject to rollover at 00:00 (GMT).</p><p>
          A credit or debit for each position opened at 00:00 (GMT) will appear in your
          account and is applied directly to your account balance.</p><p>
          <b>Weekends and Holidays</b><br />
          Most banks across the world are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, so there is no
          rollover on these days, but most banks still apply interest for Saturday and Sunday. To
          measure for this, the forex market books three days of rollover on Wednesdays, which
          makes a typical Wednesday rollover three times the amount. Please note that for some
          instruments triple swap is applied on Friday. There is no rollover on holidays, but
          there is an extra days’ worth of rollover two business days before the holiday.
          Typically, holiday rollover happens if any of the currencies traded has a major
          holiday. Therefore, President’s in the USA, February 21st, closes American banks,
          and an extra day of rollover is added at 00:00 (GMT) on the previous working day for
          all U.S.D pairs.</p><p>
